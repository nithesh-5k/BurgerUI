# BurgerUI

I have designed this UI to get experience with the technicalities of animation-based and responsive pages. I believe in my work and I personally feel that this work has achieved considerable responsiveness to fulfill the very goal.

The Burger UI is designed by [Rajveer Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rajveer-singh-43a9a0165_design-adobecc-microinteraction-activity-6707199264273039361-7ogO) which I have converted into a Flutter code base.

I have hands-on experience in working with both orthodox and unorthodox designs though I always prefer to work on unorthodox UI design, considering the scope of exploration and learning is potentially higher.
